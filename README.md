NOTE - this readme has not been reviewed and so without any guarantee.

Dependencies:
  Data dependencies for the dashboard include sensitive files, stored in 
  [STORAGE LOCATION], which requires access permissions. These files can 
  be stored in some secure local repository and pointed to by updating the 
  path string of R object "DIR_DATA_SENSITIVE" in the global.R file in git 
  repository "CovidClinicalDataRepository". 
  
  Dependencies for the landing/home page include 
  "outcomes_by_age_gender_from_march2020.gif" (generated in script 
  "gif_for_outcomes_pyramid_by_age_and_gender.R" in git repository 
  "UQ-ISARIC") AND "contributions.mp4" (stored in git repository 
  "CovidClinicalDataRepository/www", generated by "global_vis.ipynb", which 
  is stored in git repository "UQ-ISARIC". Both the gif and video 
  animations on the landing page also leverage data from 
  "ISVARIC_dash_db_20201118_preprocess.csv", which is stored in [STORAGE 
  LOCATION]. All other dependencies should be in git repo 
  CovidClinicalDataDashboard.
