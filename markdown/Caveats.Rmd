## Caveats

Patient data are collected and uploaded from start of admission, however a complete patient data set is not available until the episode of care is complete. This causes a predictable lag in available data influenced by the duration of admission which is greatest for the sickest patients, and accentuated during the up-phase of the outbreak.

These reports provide regular outputs from the ISARIC COVID-19 database.  We urge caution in interpreting unexpected results.  We have noted some unexpected results in the report, and are working with sites that submitted data to gain a greater understanding of these.
