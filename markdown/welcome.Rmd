### Welcome to the ISARIC COVID-19 Dashboard

This dashboard includes data collected by ISARIC Partners up to 20 September 2021 on patients hospitalised with COVID-19.

The ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium) partnerships and outbreak preparedness initiatives enable the rapid launch of standardised clinical data collection during epidemics and pandemics. We began collecting data on COVID-19 in Jan 2020. Extensive global uptake of this resource has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. 

This dashboard allows you to explore the data to understand the latest statistics of SARS-CoV-2 infection around the world.

If you have any questions about the content on this page, or ISARIC, or would like to know how you can become involved in this network, please email ncov@isaric.org.
