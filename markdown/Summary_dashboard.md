# COVID-19 Report
Containing data extracted 30 November 2020





## Summary
The results in this report have been produced using data from the ISARIC COVID-19 database. For information, or to contribute to the collaboration, please contact ncov@isaric.org.  

We thank all of the data contributors for collecting standardised data during these extraordinary times. We plan to issue this report of aggregate data regularly for the duration of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic.  

Please note the following caveats. This is a dynamic report which captures new variables and information as our understanding of COVID-19 evolves. Please observe the total number of patients of each result to note variables with fewer data points. Information is incomplete for the patients who are still being treated. Furthermore, it is likely that that we received more cases of severely ill individuals than those with relatively less severe illness; outcomes from these data, such as the proportion dying, must therefore not be used to infer outcomes for the entire population of people who might become infected. Some patients may be participants in clinical trials of experimental interventions. Note the variation in patient numbers per country. Additional caveats are provided in the in the ‘Caveats’ section below.  

Up to the date of this report, data have been entered for **251407** individuals from **744** sites across **57** countries.  

The analysis detailed in this report only includes individuals: 

  1. for whom data collection commenced on or before 16 November 2020. (We have applied a 14-day rule to focus analysis on individuals who are more likely to have a recorded outcome. By excluding patients enrolled during the last 14 days, we aim to reduce the number of incomplete data records and thus improve the generalisability of the results and the accuracy of the outcomes;
  
**AND**

  2. who have laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection.
  
The cohort satisfying the above criteria has **206558** cases.
The below flow chart gives an overview of the cohort and outcomes as of 30 November 2020.

## Demographics and presenting features
Of these 206558 cases, 105024 are males and 101192 are females – sex is unreported for 342 cases. The minimum and maximum observed ages were 0 and 120 years respectively. The median age is 59 years.  

The observed mean number of days from (first) symptom onset to hospital admission was 5.2, with a standard deviation (SD) of 5 days and a median of 4 days. 

The observed mean duration for the number of days from hospital admission to outcome (death or discharge) was 9.5, with SD 8.6 days and a median of 7 days. These estimates are based on all cases which have complete records on length of hospital stay (N = 182080).  

The observed symptoms on admission partly represent case definitions and policies for hospital admission, which may change as time passes. The five most common symptoms at admission were cough (no sputum), history of fever, shortness of breath, fatigue/malaise, and altered consciousness/confusion. Frequencies of symptom prevalence vary with age. 20829/90153 (23.1%) patients presented with oxygen saturations <94%.  

## Outcomes
Outcomes have been recorded for 188849 patients (91.4%), consisting of 145422 recoveries and 43427 deaths. Outcome records are unavailable for 17709 patients.  

**ICU/HDU**: A total of 19551 (9%) patients were admitted at some point of their illness into an intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU), 53.5% on the day of admission. Of these, 6580 died, and 8962 have recovered and been discharged. Outcome records are unavailable for 4009 cases.


Approximately 54% of patients with complete records on ICU admission dates were admitted to ICU within the first day of hospital admission. The distribution of the number of days from admission to ICU admission is shown in Figure 11. The duration of stay in ICU/HDU had a mean of 10.9 days and a median of 7 (SD: 10.4 days) – estimated on only those cases with complete records for ICU/HDU duration or ICU/HDU start/end dates (N = 16934). 

## Treatment
Antibiotics were received by 75845/92542 (82%) patients, and 13202/92444 (14.3%) received antivirals. These treatment categories are not mutually exclusive since some patients received multiple treatments. (The denominators differ due to data completeness). 64277/103288 (62.2%) patients received some degree of oxygen supplementation: of these, 14361/100773 (14.3%) received NIV and 12878/102609 (12.6%) IMV.  

Of the patients admitted into ICU/HDU, 16228/17242 (94.1%) received antibiotics and 5600/17121 (32.7%) antivirals. 17252/18062 (95.5%) received some degree of oxygen supplementation, of which, 8294/17916 (46.3%) received NIV and 11558/17999 (64.2%) IMV.  

A total of 14361 patients received non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV). The mean and median durations from admission to receiving NIV were 5.5 days and 2 days respectively (SD: 8.1 days) – estimated from records on cases with complete records on dates of hospital admission and NIV onset (N = 13624). The mean and median durations for NIV were 7.2 days and 4 days respectively (SD: 9.2 days) – estimated based on only those cases which have complete NIV duration records (N = 13860).  

A total of 12878 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The mean and median durations from admission to receiving IMV were 4.3 days and 2 days respectively (SD: 6.3 days) – estimated from records on cases with complete records on dates of hospital admission and IMV onset (N = 12108). The mean, median and SD for the duration of IMV – estimated based on all 12374 cases with complete records on IMV stays – were 12.9 days, 7 days and 15.3 days respectively.  

Corticosteroids were administered to 25145/97596 (25.8%) patients. This includes 6027/12321 (48.9%) of those who received IMV, 14645/49281 (29.7%) of those who had oxygen therapy but not IMV, and 4264/35346 (12.1%) of those who had no oxygen therapy. On 16 June, results for dexamethasone were released for the RECOVERY randomized controlled trial (RECOVERY, 2020; RECOVERY Collaborative Group, 2020). This trial found that dexamethasone reduced deaths for patients receiving IMV and oxygen therapy, but not among patients not receiving respiratory support. Of patients admitted since 16 June, corticosteroids were received by 2140/2825 (75.8%) of those who received IMV, 7468/9513 (78.5%) of those who had oxygen therapy but not IMV, and 1937/8178 (23.7%) of those who had no oxygen therapy.

## Background  

In response to the emergence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), ISARIC launched a portfolio of resources to accelerate outbreak research and response. These include data collection, analysis and presentation tools which are freely available to all sites which have requested access to these resources. All data collection tools are designed to address the most critical public health questions, have undergone extensive review by international clinical experts, and are free for all to use. Resources are available on the ISARIC website.  

The ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 Case Record Form (CRF) enables the collection of standardised clinical data to inform patient management and public health response. These forms should be used to collect data on suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. The CRF is available in multiple languages and is now in use across dozens of countries and research consortia, who are contributing data to these reports.   

To support researchers to retain control of the data and samples they collect, ISARIC also hosts a data platform, where data can be entered to a web-based REDCap data management system, securely stored, and used to produce regular reports on their sites as above. Data contributors are invited to input on the methods and contents of the reports, and can also contribute to the aggregated data platform which aggregates site-specific data from all other sites across the world who are using this system. For more information, visit the ISARIC website.   

All decisions regarding data use are made by the institutions that enter the data. ISARIC keeps contributors informed of any plans and welcomes their input to promote the best science and the interests of patients, institutions and public health authorities. Feedback and suggestions are welcome at ncov@isaric.org.  




## Methods 

Patient details were submitted electronically by participating sites to the ISARIC database. Relevant background and presenting symptoms were recorded on the day of study recruitment. Daily follow-up was then completed until recovery or death. A final form was completed with details of treatments received and outcomes. All categories that represent fewer than five individuals have been suppressed to avoid the potential for identification of participants.   

Graphs have been used to represent the age distribution of patients by sex and status (dead, recovered & still in hospital), the prevalence of individual symptoms on admission, comorbidities on admission, the length of hospital stay by sex and age group and the distribution of patient statuses by time since admission. In addition, the number of cases recruited by country and site, as well as the case count by status, has been represented.   

All analysis were performed using the R statistical software (R Core Team, 2019). 




## Caveats

Patient data are collected and uploaded from start of admission, however a complete patient data set is not available until the episode of care is complete. This causes a predictable lag in available data influenced by the duration of admission which is greatest for the sickest patients, and accentuated during the up-phase of the outbreak.

These reports provide regular outputs from the ISARIC COVID-19 database.  We urge caution in interpreting unexpected results.  We have noted some unexpected results in the report, and are working with sites that submitted data to gain a greater understanding of these.
