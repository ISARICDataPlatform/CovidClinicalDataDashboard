```{r, list, eval=T, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
map.data %>%
  arrange(country) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(country = paste0("**", country, "**")) %>%
  report_auth(name = "address_half",
                            subdivision = "country", name_sep = "; ") %>%
    stringr::str_replace(": ", "\n ") %>% 
    stringr::str_replace(",;", ";") %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names ="")
```
