## Summary

Up to the date of this report, data have been entered for **340312** individuals from **1736** sites across **64** countries.  

The analysis detailed in this report only includes individuals: 

  1. for whom data collection commenced on or before 3 January 2021. (We have applied a 14-day rule to focus analysis on individuals who are more likely to have a recorded outcome. By excluding patients enrolled during the last 14 days, we aim to reduce the number of incomplete data records and thus improve the generalisability of the results and the accuracy of the outcomes;
  
**AND**

  2. who have laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection.
  
The cohort satisfying the above criteria has **264496** cases.
The below flow chart gives an overview of the cohort and outcomes as of 17 January 2021.

## Demographics and presenting features
Of these 264496 cases, 136188 are males and 127692 are females – sex is unreported for 616 cases. The minimum and maximum observed ages were 0 and 120 years respectively. The median age is 61 years.  

The observed mean number of days from (first) symptom onset to hospital admission was 5.2, with a standard deviation (SD) of 4.9 days and a median of 4 days. 

The observed mean duration for the number of days from hospital admission to outcome (death or discharge) was 10, with SD 9 days and a median of 7 days. These estimates are based on all cases which have complete records on length of hospital stay (N = 230026).  

The observed symptoms on admission partly represent case definitions and policies for hospital admission, which may change as time passes. The five most common symptoms at admission were shortness of breath, cough, history of fever, fatigue/malaise, and altered consciousness/confusion. Frequencies of symptom prevalence vary with age. 33586/136988 (24.5%) patients presented with oxygen saturations <94%.  

## Outcomes
Outcomes have been recorded for 239806 patients (90.7%), consisting of 184010 recoveries and 55796 deaths. Outcome records are unavailable for 24690 patients.  

**ICU/HDU**: Of the 136337 patients with data on ward admissions available, a total of 31748 (19%) patients were admitted at some point of their illness into an intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU), 50.3% on the day of admission. Of these, 10004 died, and 16180 have recovered and been discharged. Outcome records are unavailable for 5564 cases.


The distribution of the number of days from admission to ICU admission is shown in Figure 11. The duration of stay in ICU/HDU had a mean of 10.4 days and a median of 7 (SD: 9.8 days) – estimated on only those cases with complete records for ICU/HDU duration or ICU/HDU start/end dates (N = 24160). 

## Treatment
Antibiotics were received by 116265/145463 (79.9%) patients, and 21318/144875 (14.7%) received antivirals. These treatment categories are not mutually exclusive since some patients received multiple treatments. (The denominators differ due to data completeness). 97994/158070 (62%) patients received some degree of oxygen supplementation: of these, 21763/155148 (14%) received NIV and 16915/157115 (10.8%) IMV.  

Of the patients admitted into ICU/HDU, 23096/24822 (93%) received antibiotics and 8310/24274 (34.2%) antivirals. 24631/26211 (94%) received some degree of oxygen supplementation, of which, 12469/25993 (48%) received NIV and 15125/26077 (58%) IMV.  

A total of 21763 patients received non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV). The mean and median durations from admission to receiving NIV were 5.8 days and 2 days respectively (SD: 8.3 days) – estimated from records on cases with complete records on dates of hospital admission and NIV onset (N = 20491). The mean and median durations for NIV were 3.6 days and 2 days respectively (SD: 3.2 days) – estimated based on only those cases which have complete NIV duration records (N = 2253).  

A total of 16915 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The mean and median durations from admission to receiving IMV were 5 days and 2 days respectively (SD: 7.1 days) – estimated from records on cases with complete records on dates of hospital admission and IMV onset (N = 15580). The mean, median and SD for the duration of IMV – estimated based on all 14042 cases with complete records on IMV stays – were 11 days, 9 days and 9.3 days respectively.  

Corticosteroids were administered to 55538/150491 (36.9%) patients. This includes 9057/16255 (55.7%) of those who received IMV, 36397/78159 (46.6%) of those who had oxygen therapy but not IMV, and 9641/55038 (17.5%) of those who had no oxygen therapy. On 16 June, results for dexamethasone were released for the RECOVERY randomized controlled trial (RECOVERY, 2020; RECOVERY Collaborative Group, 2020). This trial found that dexamethasone reduced deaths for patients receiving IMV and oxygen therapy, but not among patients not receiving respiratory support. Of patients admitted since 16 June, corticosteroids were received by 4367/5286 (82.6%) of those who received IMV, 27821/34746 (80.1%) of those who had oxygen therapy but not IMV, and 6983/25675 (27.2%) of those who had no oxygen therapy.
