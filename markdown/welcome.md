### Welcome to the ISARIC COVID-19 Dashboard

This dashboard provides up to date representations of data on patients hospitalised with COVID-19, collected by the ISARIC network.

The ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium) partnerships and outbreak preparedness initiatives enable the rapid launch of standardised clinical data collection during epidemics and pandemics. We began collecting data on COVID-19 in Jan 2020. Extensive global uptake of this resource has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. 

This dashboard allows you to 
- explore the data to understand the latest statistics of SARS-CoV-2 infection around the world.
- manipulate data to visualize the statistics by age, sex, date, outcome, and country (please use the red slider button on the top-left corner).
- download a summary report containing all of the graphs and tables in the dashboard. 

If you have any questions about the content on this page, or ISARIC, or would like to know how you can become involved in this network, please email ncov@isaric.org.

#### Caveats

1) Patient data are collected and uploaded from start of admission, however a complete patient data set is not available until the episode of care is complete. This causes a predictable lag in available data influenced by the duration of admission which is greatest for the sickest patients, and accentuated during the up-phase of the outbreak.

2) These reports provide regular outputs from the ISARIC COVID-19 database.  We urge caution in interpreting unexpected results.  We have noted some unexpected results in the report, and are working with sites that submitted data to gain a greater understanding of these.

3) Please pay attention to the denominators in the the frequency plots as they are ordered by proportion rather than frequency.

4) Please note that the data is split on death/discharge/LTFU mutually exclusive but not exhaustive due to missing data.
